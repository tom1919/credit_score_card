# credit_score_card
A credit score card model assigns a score to credit applicants for determining whether a loan is granted. The scores are based on weight of evidence values, logistic regression model coefficients, number of predictors, an offset and factor. The cutoff score is chosen to maximize profit based on expected acceptance and default rate. See final_report for more details
